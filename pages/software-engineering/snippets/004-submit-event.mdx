# ❇️ Getting Know the Submit Event

The use case:

- I want to know the submitter button because I have multiple buttons in the form. In `react-hook-form` the `handleSubmit` function will return the submit event.

```typescript
const onSubmit = (
  data,
  e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>
) => {
  const submitter = e?.nativeEvent?.submitter as HTMLButtonElement;
  const actionName = submitter?.name || 'propose';

  console.log('Submit action :::', actionName);
};
```
